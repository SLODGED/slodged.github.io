            <h2>DUNGON</h2>
            <p>Yes, its dungeon misspelt. Dungon was my second project over the summer of 2025, I just wanted to see what I could do before starting my final major project at university. I primarily focused on making structuring the game correctly so I could create a large variety of weapons.</p>

            <p>I was also experimenting with creating materials in Material Maker, I chose Material Maker over substance painter because I personally hate adobe and would rather struggle with non-standard software. Also, I wanted the player to be a stickman but also 3D, so I had originally made it as a pixel art but then I wanted to animate it but Unreal doesn’t have 2D skeletons so I used Illustrator (unfortunately) to trace it as a vector then imported into Blender the separated the limbs and rigged it.</p>

            <p>The stickman was intended to be a photograph of me instead but I could never get the lighting right in my photograps:</p>
