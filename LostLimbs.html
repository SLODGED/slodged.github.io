            <h2>LOST LIMBS</h2>
            <p>Lost Limbs was the third and final game for my Rapid Games Prototyping unit. The brief for this game was “unknown project”, we could create anything we wanted to. I decided to set my sights high and make a third person fighting game with limb simulation. This was my first idea and coming off of FLESH GUN: ADRENALINE JUNKIE I had really started to get to grips with creating interesting mechanics with blueprints in Unreal. I set my sights high and started work.</p>

            <p>Each limb has its own health and its own collision box, I had wanted to simulate collisions per polygon but the way I had built the system meant that would require time that I didn’t have</p>

            <p>Originally when I was coming up with the idea I was inspired by Metal Gear: Rising Revengance's Blade mode but I simplified it down to something more achiveable.</p>
