    <h1>Section Summary:</h1>
    <p>Last Limbs was the final and hardest game to make in my Rapid Games Prototyping Unit, I had big hopes for this project and while it wasn't exactly what I intended to do I am very proud of the end product.</p>
    <p>In this prototype we were allowed to make any game we wanted, I wanted to make an action RPG type game with melee combat and a magic system, naturally I scaled it back to just melee combat but from that I decided to have each limb on the players' body be simulated.</p>
    <br>

  <p>Each limb on the character's body is a separate skeletal mesh asset, the animations are played by the "Set Leader Pose" node which is intended for a much simpler form of modular character. Originally, I wanted per-poly collision however the node I was using to copy the animations to each skeletal mesh disabled all forms of collision meaning I would have to individually add collision boxes to each limb.</p>
  <p>This discovery took about half of the development time making the next half very rushed and resulting in the mess of a limb detection function seen below.</p>
  <iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/0xkbnnfm/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen width="500" height="500"></iframe>
  <p>This function runs on every limb that is hit by a weapon, if a limb determines that its health is 0, it will then spawn gibs of itself and all of its child limbs.</p>
  <p>This isn't the worst optimised part however, as I wanted to reuse the "guy" as it is called in game for both the player and the enemy I created a so called base pawn which would be implemented into a character actor for the enemy and player as a child actor and on each game tick having the character movement cast to thier child actor the relevant information to play the animations correctly.</p>
  <p>It doesn't actually run that poorly as there are only five values that are passed through.</p>

        <p>One particular highlight for me was creating the health diagram, each colour represents a certain health level of each limb. Each limb has a different health level depending on how "hardy" I determined each limb to be.</p>

  <p>There are two different weapons (not including the punch) along with one shield in this game. Each weapon has different properties and each weapon has three different attack types: Slash, Stab, and Slam.</p>
<br>
  <h2>Sword</h2>
  <div class ="image">
      <div class ="container">
          <img src="Assets/Sword.png" style="width:135px;height:548px;">
          <p>It's a classic weapon and also the first I implemented, it doesn't deal as much damage as the cudgel but it is makes up for this with its speed and versatility in all combat scenarios.</p>
      </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Cudgel</h2>
  <div class ="image">
      <div class ="container">
          <img src="Assets/Cudgel.png" style="width:31px;height:347px;">
          <p>I wanted a unique weapon that isn't featured often in games and unlike the glorified battle axe and fantastical morning star, cudgels were used throughout history in various forms. In this game it is a slow and heavy weapon but it can one-shot most foes that come your way, but if you miss you die.</p>
      </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Shield</h2>
  <div class ="image">
      <div class ="container">
          <img src="Assets/Shield.png" style="width:184px;height:166px;">
          <p>The shield is your protection from the enemy onslaught, if you or an enemy hit a shield with a weapon the hitter staggers and the shield holder loses stamina.</p>
